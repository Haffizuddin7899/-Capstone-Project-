Project's Title: â€œFungal Disease Detection In Plants Using Leaf Images"

The symptoms of plant diseases are evident in different parts of a plant; however leaves are found to be the most commonly observed part for detecting an infection.

The purpose of our project is to leverage AI and computer vision technologies to address the  agricultural challenges faced by farmers in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. Specifically, we aim to develop a system for the early detection and diagnosis of crop diseases using leaf images.

Gilgit-Baltistan, located in the northern region of Pakistan, is characterized by a challenging terrain and harsh climatic conditions. Agriculture is the primary source of livelihood for the majority of its population, and the region plays a important role in the country's food production.
      However, Gilgit-Baltistan's agriculture faces significant challenges:
Crop Yield Reduction
Limited Access to Expertise
Harsh Environmental Conditions
